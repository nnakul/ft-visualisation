## ABOUT
The project uses the *discrete fourier transform* algorithm to build an application that replicates whatever is drawn by representing it as a series of epicycles. In other words, the application aims at obtaining the fourier series representation of the drawing, in a similar way in which it is obtained for a sqaure or a triangular wave.
